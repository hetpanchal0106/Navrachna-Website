    <h1 align="center">Choice Based Ciriculum</h1>
    <p>Navrachana University, Vadodara (NUV) has implemented choice based curriculum that gives student a range of choices and flexibility to choose courses across the school of their interest.<br>
 

        All the programs of NUV offers 85% of the credits pertaining to mandatory courses. A student is free to pick remaining 15% from any School of the University in the form of elective courses. In this, student must select 1/3rd elective courses outside of the school. However, student can choose rest of the 2/3rd elective courses either from their own School or other schools of Navrachana University.<br>
         
        
        So every semester on an average, a student will take 2 elective courses of his/ her choice. Student can pick these elective courses from any of the schools of NUV. Even mandatory courses of one school may be offered as electives for students of other schools. This means that each student of any program at NUV would have done different courses based on his/ her passion or professional plans. (For example a student of Mechanical Engineering might decide to pick design courses from SEDA or a student of BBA might decide to pick language courses from SLSE or a BSc student who decides to pick courses on business and finance from SBL).</p>
