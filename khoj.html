        <P>The Khoj program has been one of the defining social immersion activity at Navrachana University. Conceived right during the inception of the University, the Khoj program was envisaged to be a vehicle to inculcate social awareness, empathy and inter-disciplinary skills amongst our students, with a larger aim of proposing solutions to societal problems through innovation.<br>

 

            To further strengthen these foundational ideas of Khoj program and to engage on topics that are relevant and can be made visible to the society at large, the program is now conceived as a larger and more ambitious activity that is undertaken by students and faculty members during the semester break under the umbrella of KHOJ WINTER SCHOOL. The aim is to administer the Khoj program as intense, rigorous and field based activity in workshop mode while addressing a pressing social issue in the region in and around Vadodara. This format has led to an uninterrupted and concentrated involvements of the students and their mentors.<br>
            
             
            
            Faculty members had offered interesting, innovative and relevant khoj projects in the areas of urban labour, migration, traffic, ecology, farming practices, public spaces, social behaviour etc. Students have chosen projects based on their interest and have done meticulous work to achieve the designed objectives. In this process, they have learned to address an issue using interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary approach hence leading to deeper insights into their understanding.</P>
